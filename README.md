## Welcome LKCFES-Department of Internet Engineering (DIECS) students

### MENTOR-MENTEE PROGRAM
**UTAR IT Society's mentor-mentee program** strives to improve students' academic performance and increase students' drive in pursuing Software Engineering course.
We are aware that **students motivation** determines the academic performance as well as their success in the related field in long run. 
With the guidance of senior student / alumni as mentors, we hope that students can gain career perspectives, meet new friends and **achieve their desired goals**.

### How it works?

The program involves **both parties, mentor and mentee**. The mentor will be a senior student/ alumni, while mentee can be students from any year/trimester.
**As a mentor**, you will be guiding on mentee on his/her preferred subject that he/she wishes to improve on. 
Besides, you can also provide insights on general Software Engineering student must knows, such as course planning, extracurricular activities etc.
**As a mentee**, you will gain opportunities in improving your academic performance in the selected subject, gain networks, as well as better understand yourself and Software Engineering field.
