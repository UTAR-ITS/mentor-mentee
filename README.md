## Welcome LKCFES-Department of Internet Engineering (DIECS) students

MENTOR-MENTEE PROGRAM
UTAR IT Society's mentor-mentee program strives to improve students' academic performance and increase students drive in pursuing Software Engineering course.
We are aware that students motivation determines the academic performance as well as success in the related field in long run. 
With the guidance of senior student / alumni as mentors, we hope that students can gain career perspectives, meet new friends and achieve their desired goals.

### How it works?

The program involves both parties, mentor and mentee. The mentor will be a senior student/ alumni, while mentee can be students from any year/trimester.
As a mentor, you will be guiding on mentee on his/her preferred subject that he/she wishes to improve on. 
Besides, you can also provide insights on general Software Engineering student must know, such as course planning, extracurricular activities etc.
As a mentee, you will gain opportunities in improving your academic performance in the selected subject, network, as well as better understand yourself and Software Engineering field.
