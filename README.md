## Welcome LKCFES-Department of Internet Engineering (DIECS) students

### MENTOR-MENTEE PROGRAM
**UTAR IT Society's mentor-mentee program** strives to improve students' academic performance and increase students' drive in pursuing Software Engineering course.
We are aware that **students motivation** determines the academic performance as well as their success in the related field in long run. 
With the guidance of senior student / alumni as mentors, we hope that students can gain career perspectives, meet new friends and **achieve their desired goals**.
